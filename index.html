                Dwarakadish Temple
            </h3>
            <p>
                Around 200 AD king Vasudeva II who was Dwarka king at the time lost his kingdom to Mahakshatriya Rudradama. After the demise of Rudradama, Queen Dheeradevi invited to Pulumavi, wishing to have his guidance regarding the ruling of the kingdom. Rudradama was a follower of Vaishnav religion and was a worshipper of Lord Krishna. Later on his successor Vajranabha constructed a Chhattri and enshrined Lord Krishna’s idol in it. Adi Guru Shankaracharya founded the Chardham in order to revive Hinduism. A Hindu monastic centre was set up at the place where today stands the Dwarka temple. Around 885 AD head of Shrimad Jagadguru Shankaracharya Pith’, Shree Nrushinhaashrma renovated the temple of Dwarka.

            <h3>
                Vrindavan Temple
            </h3>
            <p>
                Vrindavan, which today is a town of around 63,000 people, is a place in peril. It continues to attract ever more people from around India and around the world, with some estimates putting the annual number of visitors at over 32 million! The Yamuna river, considered by devotees a Goddess who grants closeness to Krishna, is extremely polluted in Vrindavan. Upstream dams and farm and industrial pollution have placed the river in a horrible state before it even reaches Vrindavan, where untreated sewage still goes into the river. Squatters build on the Yamuna floodplain necessary for the maintenance of underground water tables and even government agencies are building illegally without considering their environmental impact.
